# Identifying Causal and Non-causal verb alternations in Hindi

Provides a framework to identify causative (causal) and anticausatives (non-causal) for Light Verb Constructions (LVC) found in Hindi
For the analysis the focus was on finding nouns occuring with both /kar/ 'do' and /ho/ 'be' verbs in Hindi. The occurence of nouns with /kar/ in a LVC is taken as causative and with /ho/ as anticausative as suugested in [2].

* calculates the C/A ratio for the nouns alternating as causal and non-causal and gives a spontenity scale
* calculates the probability of a noun to occur as causative noun
* calculates the probability of a noun to occur as causative noun when not occurring with highly frequent verbs. For our purpose the verbs 'do', 'give', and 'take' have been selected
